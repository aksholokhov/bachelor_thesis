abstract = {One of the responsibilities of power market regulator is setting rules for selecting and prioritizing demand response (DR) programs. There are many different alternatives of DR programs for improving load profile characteristics and achieving customers' satisfaction. Regulator should find the optimal solution which reflects the perspectives of each DR stakeholder. Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) is a proper method for handling such optimization problems. In this paper, an extended responsive load economic model is developed. The model is based on price elasticity and customer benefit function. Prioritizing of DR programs can be realized by means of Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Considerations of ISO/utility/customer regarding the weighting of attributes are encountered by entropy method. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for selecting the most effective DR program. Numerical studies are conducted on the load curve of the Iranian power grid in 2007. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Smart Grid is designed to integrate advanced communication/networking technologies into electrical power grids to make them "smarter". Current situation is that most of the blackouts and voltage sags could be prevented if we have better and faster communication devices and technologies for the electrical grid. In order to make the current electrical power grid a Smart Grid, the design and implementation of a new communication infrastructure for the grid are two important fields of research. However, Smart Grid projects have only been proposed in recent years and only a few proposals for forward-looking requirements and initial research work have been offered in this field. No any systematic reviews of communication/networking in Smart Grids have been conducted yet. Therefore, we conduct a systematic review of communication/networking technologies in Smart Grid in this paper, including communication/networking architecture, different communication technologies that would be employed into this architecture, quality of service (QoS), optimizing utilization of assets, control and management, etc. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Shishlov2016,
abstract = {This article provides an ex post analysis of the compliance of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol during the first commitment period (2008–2012) based on the final data for national GHG emissions and exchanges in carbon units that became available at the end of 2015. On the domestic level, among the 36 countries that fully participated in the Kyoto Protocol, only nine countries emitted higher levels of GHGs than committed and therefore had to resort to flexibility mechanisms. On the international level – i.e. after the use of flexibility mechanisms – all Annex B Parties are in compliance. Countries implemented different compliance strategies: purchasing carbon units abroad, stimulating the domestic use of carbon credits by the private sector and incentivizing domestic emission reductions through climate policies.Overall, the countries party to the Protocol surpassed their aggregate commitment by an average 2.4 GtCO2e yr–1. Of the possible explanations for this overachievement, ‘hot-air' was estimated at 2.2 GtCO2e yr–1, while accounting rules for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) further removed 0.4 GtCO2e yr–1 from the net result excluding LULUCF. The hypothetical participation of the US and Canada would have reduced this overachievement by a net 1 GtCO2e yr–1. None of these factors – some of which may be deemed illegitimate – would therefore on its own have led to global non-compliance, even without use of the 0.3 GtCO2e of annual emissions reductions generated by the Clean Development Mechanism. The impact of domestic policies and ‘carbon leakage' – neither of which is quantitatively assessed here – should not be neglected either.Policy relevanceGiven the ongoing evolution of the international climate regime and the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, we believe that there is a need to evaluate the results of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. To our knowledge there has been no overarching quantitative ex post assessment of the Kyoto Protocol based on the final emissions data for 2008–2012, which became available in late 2015. This article attempts to fill this gap, focusing on the domestic and international compliance of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in the first commitment period.},

abstract = {Smart grid is a new emerging technology which is able to intelligently control the power consumption via network. Therefore, the efficiency of the information exchange between the power suppliers (or control centers) and power customers is an important issue for smart grid. Moreover, the performance of the smart grid usually depends on the customer's satisfaction degree which belongs to the field of quality of experience. In this article, we propose a QoE-driven power scheduling in the context of smart grid from the perspectives of architecture, strategy, and methodology. Specifically, it takes into account the QoE requirement when designing the power allocation scheme. For obtaining the QoE requirement, we analyze the fluctuation of the power load and the impact of the transmission delay. In particular, the power allocation is formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the social welfare of the system. Based on the given QoE model, an efficient power scheduling scheme is proposed by jointly considering the admission control and QoE expectation. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can efficiently allocate the power according to the dynamic QoE requirements in a practical smart grid system.},

abstract = {Recently, a massive focus has been made on demand response (DR) programs, aimed to electricity price reduction, transmission lines congestion resolving, security enhancement and improvement of market liquidity. Basically, demand response programs are divided into two main categories namely, incentive-based programs and time-based programs. The focus of this paper is on Interruptible/Curtailable service (I/C) and capacity market programs (CAP), which are incentive-based demand response programs including penalties for customers in case of no responding to load reduction. First, by using the concept of price elasticity of demand and customer benefit function, economic model of above mentioned programs is developed. The proposed model helps the independent system operator (ISO) to identify and employ relevant DR program which both improves the characteristics of the load curve and also be welcome by customers. To evaluate the performance of the model, simulation study has been conducted using the load curve of the peak day of the Iranian power system grid in 2007. In the numerical study section, the impact of these programs on load shape and load level, and benefit of customers as well as reduction of energy consumption are shown. In addition, by using strategy success indices the results of simulation studies for different scenarios are analyzed and investigated for determination of the scenarios priority. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2006 We introduce a class of MPDs which greatly simplify Reinforcement Learning. They have discrete state spaces and continuous control spaces. The controls have the effect of rescaling the transition probabilities of an underlying Markov chain. A control cost penalizing KL divergence between controlled and uncontrolled transition probabilities makes the minimization problem convex, and allows an-alytical computation of the optimal controls given the optimal value function. An exponential transformation of the optimal value function makes the minimized Bellman equation linear. Apart from their theoretical signiicance, the new MDPs enable ef approximations to traditional MDPs. Shortest path problems are approximated to arbitrary precision with largest eigenvalue problems, yielding an O (n) algorithm. Accurate approximations to generic MDPs are obtained via continuous embedding reminiscent of LP relaxation in integer programming. Off-policy learning of the optimal value function is possible without need for state-action values; the new algorithm (Z-learning) outperforms Q-learning.},

A statistical modeling approach based on Markov Chains is used to describe the evolution of probability mass in a temperature state space. The Markov state transition matrix is identified using state information from the population of thermostatically controlled loads.

abstract = {Demand Response (DR) is a set of time-dependent program activities and tariffs that seek to reduce electricity use or shift usage to another time period. DR provides control systems that encourage load shedding or load shifting during times when the electric grid is near its capacity or electricity prices are high. DR helps to manage building electricity costs and to improve electric grid reliability. This report provides an introduction to commercial building control strategies and techniques for demad response. Many electric utilities have been exploring the use of critical peak pricing (CPP) and otherdemand response programs to help reduce summer peaks in customer electric loads. This reponds to an identified need among building operators for knowledge to use DR strategies in their buildings. These strategies can be implemented using either manual or automated methods. The report compiles information from field demonstrations of DR programs in commercial buildings. The guide provides a framework for categorizing the control strategies that have been tested in actual buildings. the guide's emphasis is on characterizing and describing DR control strategies for air-conditioning and ventilation systems. There is also good coverage of lighting control strategies. The guide provides some additional introduction to DR strategies for other miscellaneous building end-use systems and non-component-based DR strategies. The core information in this report is based on DR field tests in 28 non-residential buildings, most of which were in California, and the rest of which were in New York State. The majority of the participating buildings were office buildings. Most of the California buildings participated in fully automated demand response field tests.},

abstract = {This paper presents design considerations for a centralized load controller to control thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) for continuous regulation reserves (CRRs). The controller logics for setting up the baseline load, generating priority lists, issuing dispatch commands, and tuning the simplified forecaster model using measurement data are described. To study the impacts of different control parameter settings on control performance and device lifetimes, a system consisting of 1000 heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units in their heating modes is modeled to provide a CRR 24 hours a day. Four cases are modeled to evaluate the impact of forecasting errors, minimum HVAC turn-off times, response delays, and consumer overrides. The results demonstrate that a centralized TCA load controller can provide robust, good quality CRRs with reduced communication needs for the two-way communication network and inexpensive load control devices. Most importantly, because the controller precisely controls the aggregated HVAC load shapes while maintaining load diversity, the controllable and measurable load services that it provides can be used for many other demand response applications, such as peak shaving, load shifting, and arbitrage.},

abstract = {Aggregations of demand response resources can provide a variety of services to the power grid. To utilize them effectively, for both planning problems and real-time control, we must estimate their flexibility. However, flexibility estimates are uncertain because of issues such as model error and forecasting error. In this paper, we present a model of uncertain flexibility and describe the many causes of uncertainty. We conduct two case studies, one for electric vehicle aggregations and one for air conditioner aggregations, in order to show specific examples that illustrate the causes and magnitude of uncertainty. We find that uncertainty can be very large for small load aggregations, when models do not capture enough of the underlying dynamics, or when forecasts of other quantities, such as ambient conditions, are bad. Although the focus of the paper is on understanding uncertainty, we also briefly discuss how one might use knowledge of uncertainty distributions in planning problems to derive closer-to-optimal results.},

abstract = {Demand response from flexible electric loads such as electric vehicles, air conditioners, and smart home appliances represents a vast, clean, and potentially high-performance resource for the electric power system. Compared with traditional resources such as generators, transmission lines, and storage devices, loads are highly uncertain. Although effective techniques have been developed over the past century for accommodating load uncertainty in power system operations, new techniques are required to enable loads to become a reliable and effective resource for the power system operator. Much of this uncertainty falls under the purview of the load aggregator, whose job it is to provide power system services such as load shifting, curtailment, and regulation by managing the power consumption of individual members of a load population. A load aggregator may not know the state or model of a load and furthermore may not be able to directly measure the loads' responses to its commands. In this paper, we survey techniques for managing load uncertainty in demand response. Our discussion is organized into three problem types: identifying load models, estimating load states, and learning these features in conjunction with deploying the loads for demand response. We also discuss new challenges and future directions for each problem type.},

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of optimal dynamic pricing for retail electricity with an unknown demand model is considered. Under the day-ahead dynamic pricing (a.k.a. real time pricing) mechanism, a retailer obtains electricity in a twosettlement wholesale market and serves its customers in real time. Without knowledge on the aggregated demand function of its customers, the retailer aims to maximize its retail surplus by sequentially adjusting its price based on the behavior of its customers in the past. An online learning algorithm, referred to as piecewise linear stochastic approximation (PWLSA), is proposed. It is shown that PWLSA achieves the optimal rate of learning defined by the growth rate of cumulative regret. In particular, the regret of PWLSA is shown to grow logarithmically with respect to the learning horizon, and no other on-line learning algorithm can have the growth rate slower than that of PWLSA. Simulation studies are presented using traces of actual day-ahead prices, and PWLSA compares favorably under both static and dynamically changing parameters.},

abstract = {Demand response programs incentivize loads to actively moderate their energy consumption to aid the power system. Uncertainty is an intrinsic aspect of demand response because a load's capability is often unknown until the load has been deployed. Algorithms must therefore balance utilizing well-characterized, good loads and learning about poorly characterized but potentially good loads; this is a manifestation of the classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We address this tradeoff in a restless bandit framework, a generalization of the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. The formulation yields index policies in which loads are ranked by a scalar index, and those with the highest are deployed. The policy is particularly appropriate for demand response because the indices have explicit analytical expressions that may be evaluated separately for each load, making them both simple and scalable. This formulation serves as a heuristic basis for when only the aggregate effect of demand response is observed, from which the state of each individual load must be inferred. We formulate a tractable, analytical approximation for individual state inference based on observations of aggregate load curtailments. In numerical examples, the restless bandit policy outperforms the greedy policy by 5{\%}-10{\%} of the total cost. When the states of deployed loads are inferred from aggregate measurements, the resulting performance degradation is on the order of a few percent for the (now heuristic) restless bandit policy.},

abstract = {Demand response program with real-time pricing can encourage electricity users towards scheduling their energy usage to off-peak hours. A user needs to schedule the energy usage of his appliances in an online manner since he may not know the energy prices and the demand of his appliances ahead of time. In this paper, we study the users' long-term load scheduling problem and model the changes of the price information and load demand as a Markov decision process, which enables us to capture the interactions among users as a partially observable stochastic game. To make the problem tractable, we approximate the users' optimal scheduling policy by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) of a fully observable stochastic game with incomplete information. We develop an online load scheduling learning (LSL) algorithm based on the actor-critic method to determine the users' MPE policy. When compared with the benchmark of not performing demand response, simulation results show that the LSL algorithm can reduce the expected cost of users and the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in the aggregate load by 28{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively. When compared with the short-term scheduling policies, the users with the long-term policies can reduce their expected cost by 17{\%}},

abstract = {A Markov decision process (MDP) framework is adopted to represent ensemble control of devices with cyclic energy consumption patterns, e.g., thermostatically controlled loads. Specifically we utilize and develop the class of MDP models previously coined linearly solvable MDPs, that describe optimal dynamics of the probability distribution of an ensemble of many cycling devices. Two principally different settings are discussed. First, we consider optimal strategy of the ensemble aggregator balancing between minimization of the cost of operations and minimization of the ensemble welfare penalty, where the latter is represented as a KL-divergence between actual and normal probability distributions of the ensemble. Then, second, we shift to the demand response setting modeling the aggregator's task to minimize the welfare penalty under the condition that the aggregated consumption matches the targeted time-varying consumption requested by the system operator. We discuss a modification of both settings aimed at encouraging or constraining the transitions between different states. The dynamic programming feature of the resulting modified MDPs is always preserved; however, `linear solvability' is lost fully or partially, depending on the type of modification. We also conducted some (limited in scope) numerical experimentation using the formulations of the first setting. We conclude by discussing future generalizations and applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider residential demand response (DR) programs where an aggregator calls upon some residential customers to change their demand so that the total load adjustment is as close to a target value as possible. Major challenges lie in the uncertainty and randomness of the customer behaviors in response to DR signals, and the limited knowledge available to the aggregator of the customers. To learn and select the right customers, we formulate the DR problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with a reliability goal. We propose a learning algorithm: CUCB- Avg (Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound-Average), which utilizes both upper confidence bounds and sample averages to balance the tradeoff between exploration (learning) and exploitation (selecting). We prove that CUCB-Avg achieves O(log T) regret given a time-invariant target, and o(T) regret when the target is time-varying. Simulation results demonstrate that our CUCB-Avg performs significantly better than the classic algorithm CUCB (Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound) in both time-invariant and time-varying scenarios.

In this paper, we consider households that operate different appliances including PHEVs and batteries and propose a demand response approach based on utility maximization. Each appliance provides a certain benefit depending on the pattern or volume of power it consumes. Each household wishes to optimally schedule its power consumption so as to maximize its individual net benefit subject to various consumption and power flow constraints. We show that there exist time-varying prices that can align individual optimality with social optimality, i.e., under such prices, when the households selfishly optimize their own benefits, they automatically also maximize the social welfare. The utility company can thus use dynamic pricing to coordinate demand responses to the benefit of the overall system. We propose a distributed algorithm for the utility company and the customers to jointly compute this optimal prices and demand schedules. Finally, we present simulation results that illustrate several interesting properties of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {— We consider the problem of determining the optimal aggregate power consumption of a population of ther-mostatically controlled loads. This is motivated by the problem of synthesizing the demand response for a load serving entity (LSE) serving a population of such customers. We show how the LSE can opportunistically design the aggregate reference consumption to minimize its energy procurement cost, given day-ahead price, load and ambient temperature forecasts, while respecting each individual load's comfort range constraints. The resulting synthesis problem is shown to be amenable to optimal control techniques, but computationally difficult otherwise. Numerical simulations elucidate how the LSE can use the optimal aggregate power consumption trajectory thus computed, for the purpose of demand response.},

abstract = {The smart grid concept continues to evolve and various methods have been developed in order to enhance the energy efficiency of the electricity infrastructure. Demand Response (DR) is considered as the most cost-effective and reliable solution for the smoothing of the demand curve, when the system is under stress. DR refers to a procedure that is applied to motivate changes in the customers' power consumption habits, in response to incentives regarding the electricity prices. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of various DR schemes and programs, based on the motivations offered to the consumers in order to participate in the program.We classify the proposed DR schemes according to their control mechanism, to the motivations offered to reduce the power consumption and to the DR decision variable. We also present various optimization models for the optimal control of the DR strategies that have been proposed so far. These models are also categorized, based on the target of the optimization procedure. The key aspects that should be considered in the optimization problem are the system's constraints and the computational complexity of the applied optimization algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper describes the impacts of different types of DR (demand response) activation on TCLs' (thermostatically controlled loads) aggregated power. The different parties: power system operators, DR service providers (or aggregators) and consumers, have different objectives in relation to DR activation. The outcome of this experimental study quantifies the actual flexibility of household TCLs and the consequence for the different parties with respect to power behaviour. Each DR activation method adopts different scenarios to meet the power reduction, and has different impacts on the parameters. The experiments are conducted with real domestic refrigerators representing TCL. Activating refrigerators for DR with a delay reduces the ISE (integral square error) in power limitation by 28.46{\%}, overshoot by 7.69{\%}. The delay in refrigerator activation causes reduction in power ramp down rate by 39.90{\%}, ramp up rate by 21.30{\%} and the instantaneous average temperature increases by 0.13{\%} in comparison with the scenario without activation delay.},

abstract = {Driven by recent advances in batch Reinforcement Learning (RL), this paper contributes to the application of batch RL to demand response. In contrast to conventional model-based approaches, batch RL techniques do not require a system identification step, making them more suitable for a large-scale implementation. This paper extends fitted Q-iteration, a standard batch RL technique, to the situation when a forecast of the exogenous data is provided. In general, batch RL techniques do not rely on expert knowledge about the system dynamics or the solution. However, if some expert knowledge is provided, it can be incorporated by using the proposed policy adjustment method. Finally, we tackle the challenge of finding an open-loop schedule required to participate in the day-ahead market. We propose a model-free Monte Carlo method that uses a metric based on the state-action value function or Q-function and we illustrate this method by finding the day-ahead schedule of a heat-pump thermostat. Our experiments show that batch RL techniques provide a valuable alternative to model-based controllers and that they can be used to construct both closed-loop and open-loop policies.},

abstract = {Demand response (DR) for residential and small commercial buildings is estimated to account for as much as 65{\%} of the total energy savings potential of DR, and previous work shows that a fully automated energy management system (EMS) is a necessary prerequisite to DR in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and argue that this RL problem can be approximately solved by decomposing it over device clusters. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, allows the user to initiate more flexible requests, and has a computational complexity linear in the number of device clusters. We also demonstrate the simulation results of applying Q-learning, one of the most popular and classical RL algorithms, to a representative example.},

abstract = {A demand response aggregator, that manages a large cluster of heterogeneous flexibility carriers, faces a complex optimal control problem. Moreover, in most applications of demand response an exact description of the system dynamics and constraints is unavailable, and information comes mostly from observations of system trajectories. This paper presents a model-free approach for controlling a cluster of domestic electric water heaters. The objective is to schedule the cluster at minimum electricity cost by using the thermal storage of the water tanks. The control scheme applies a model-free batch reinforcement learning (batch RL) algorithm in combination with a market-based heuristic. The considered batch RL technique is tested in a stochastic setting, without prior information or model of the system dynamics of the cluster. The simulation results show that the batch RL technique is able to reduce the daily electricity cost within a reasonable learning period of 40-45 days, compared to a hysteresis controller.},

Two-sided centrallized architecutre was assumed: WH send current temperatures of layers, and an aggregator responds to them with "charging priority p". Then regarding to this charging priorities the aggregator determines the optimal "priority threshold". Having the priority below the threshold a HV starts heating, and stalls otherwise. The goal was to determine optimal consumption for each moment regarfing to minimization of total consumption. Batch-Q-learning was applied as the learning algorithm, where one batch consists of all daily transactions. A slight reduction in total consumption was demonstrated after 40-45 days of learning, however, no comparsion with competitors was provided, so I have no idea whether it is a good reduction or not.},

Motivated by the need to reduce costs arising from electricity shortage and renewable energy fluctuations, we propose a novel multi-armed bandit mechanism for demand response (MAB-MDR) which makes monetary offers to strategic consumers who have unknown response characteristics, to incetivize reduction in demand. Our work is inspired by a novel connection we make to crowdsourcing mechanisms. The proposed mecha-nism incorporates realistic features of the demand response problem including time varying and quadratic cost function. The mechanism marries auctions, that allow users to report their preferences, with online algorithms, that allow distribu-tion companies to learn user-specific parameters. We show that MAB-MDR is dominant strategy incentive compatible, in-dividually rational, and achieves sublinear regret. Such mech-anisms can be effectively deployed in smart grids using new information and control architecture innovations and lead to welcome savings in energy costs.},

abstract = {The capabilities of electric loads participating in load curtailment programs are often unknown until the loads have been told to curtail (i.e., deployed) and observed. In programs in which payments are made each time a load is deployed, we aim to pick the 'best' loads to deploy in each time step. Our choice is a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, i.e., curtailing poorly characterized loads in order to better characterize them in the hope of benefiting in the future versus curtailing well-characterized loads so that we benefit now. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed restless bandit problem with controlled bandits. In contrast to past work that has assumed all load parameters are known allowing the use of optimization approaches, we assume the parameters of the controlled system are unknown and develop an online learning approach. Our problem has two features not commonly addressed in the bandit literature: the arms/processes evolve according to different probabilistic laws depending on the control, and the reward/feedback observed by the decision-maker is the total realized curtailment, not the curtailment of each load. We develop an adaptive demand response learning algorithm and an extended version that works with aggregate feedback, both aimed at approximating the Whittle index policy. We show numerically that the regret of our algorithms with respect to the Whittle index policy is of logarithmic order in time, and significantly outperforms standard learning algorithms like UCB1.},

We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality.

Adaptive stopping algorithms monitor the performance in an online fashion and they can stop early, saving valuable resources. We consider problems where probabilistic guarantees are desired and demonstrate how recently-introduced empirical Bernstein bounds can be used to design stopping rules that are efficient. We provide upper bounds on the sample complexity of the new rules, as well as empirical results on model selection and boosting in the filtering setting.},

abstract = {Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5{\%} click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.},

abstract = {Algorithms based on upper confidence bounds for balancing exploration and exploitation are gaining popularity since they are easy to implement, efficient and effective. This paper considers a variant of the basic algorithm for the stochastic, multi-armed bandit problem that takes into account the empirical variance of the different arms. In earlier experimental works, such algorithms were found to outperform the competing algorithms. We provide the first analysis of the expected regret for such algorithms. As expected, our results show that the algorithm that uses the variance estimates has a major advantage over its alternatives that do not use such estimates provided that the variances of the payoffs of the suboptimal arms are low. We also prove that the regret concentrates only at a polynomial rate. This holds for all the upper confidence bound based algorithms and for all bandit problems except those special ones where with probability one the payoff obtained by pulling the optimal arm is larger than the expected payoff for the second best arm. Hence, although upper confidence bound bandit algorithms achieve logarithmic expected regret rates, they might not be suitable for a risk-averse decision maker. We illustrate some of the results by computer simulations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we showthat the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective. What distinguishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming. We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

In this paper, we design and analyze a generalization of Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied versions of the contextual bandits problem. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling.

This article describes a heuristic for managing multi-armed bandits called randomized probability matching, which randomly allocates observations to arms according the Bayesian posterior probability that each arm is optimal. Advances in Bayesian computation have made randomized probability matching easy to apply to virtually any payoff distribution. This flexibility frees the experimenter to work with payoff distributions that correspond to certain classical experimental designs that have the potential to outperform methods that are ‘optimal' in simpler contexts.

The outcome of this experimental study quantifies the actual flexibility of household TCLs and the consequence for the different parties with respect to power behaviour. Each DR activation method adopts different scenarios to meet the power reduction, and has different impacts on the parameters. The experiments are conducted with real domestic refrigerators representing TCL. Activating refrigerators for DR with a delay reduces the ISE (integral square error) in power limitation by 28.46{\%}, overshoot by 7.69{\%}. The delay in refrigerator activation causes reduction in power ramp down rate by 39.90{\%}, ramp up rate by 21.30{\%} and the instantaneous average temperature increases by 0.13{\%} in comparison with the scenario without activation delay.},

We show how the LSE can opportunistically design the aggregate reference consumption to minimize its energy procurement cost, given day-ahead price, load and ambient temperature forecasts, while respecting each individual load's comfort range constraints. The resulting synthesis problem is shown to be amenable to optimal control techniques, but computationally difficult otherwise. Numerical simulations elucidate how the LSE can use the optimal aggregate power consumption trajectory thus computed, for the purpose of demand response.},

abstract = {Although many algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem are well-understood theoretically, empirical confirmation of their effectiveness is generally scarce. This paper presents a thorough empirical study of the most popular multi-armed bandit algorithms. Three important observations can be made from our results. Firstly, simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy and Boltzmann exploration outperform theoretically sound algorithms on most settings by a significant margin. Secondly, the performance of most algorithms varies dramatically with the parameters of the bandit problem. Our study identifies for each algorithm the settings where it performs well, and the settings where it performs poorly. Thirdly, the algorithms' performance relative each to other is affected only by the number of bandit arms and the variance of the rewards. This finding may guide the design of subsequent empirical evaluations. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to an important area of application of bandit algorithms: clinical trials. Although the design of clinical trials has been one of the principal practical problems motivating research on multi-armed bandits, bandit algorithms have never been evaluated as potential treatment allocation strategies. Using data from a real study, we simulate the outcome that a 2001-2002 clinical trial would have had if bandit algorithms had been used to allocate patients to treatments. We find that an adaptive trial would have successfully treated at least 50{\%} more patients, while significantly reducing the number of adverse effects and increasing patient retention. At the end of the trial, the best treatment could have still been identified with a high level of statistical confidence. Our findings demonstrate that bandit algorithms are attractive alternatives to current adaptive treatment allocation strategies.},

In this paper, we consider households that operate different appliances including PHEVs and batteries and propose a demand response approach based on utility maximization. Each appliance provides a certain benefit depending on the pattern or volume of power it consumes. Each household wishes to optimally schedule its power consumption so as to maximize its individual net benefit subject to various consumption and power flow constraints. We show that there exist time-varying prices that can align individual optimality with social optimality, i.e., under such prices, when the households selfishly optimize their own benefits, they automatically also maximize the social welfare. The utility company can thus use dynamic pricing to coordinate demand responses to the benefit of the overall system. We propose a distributed algorithm for the utility company and the customers to jointly compute this optimal prices and demand schedules. Finally, we present simulation results that illustrate several interesting properties of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {This paper explores a new framework for reinforcement learning based on online convex optimization, in particular mirror descent and related algorithms. Mirror descent can be viewed as an enhanced gradient method, particularly suited to minimization of convex functions in highdimensional spaces. Unlike traditional gradient methods, mirror descent undertakes gradient updates of weights in both the dual space and primal space, which are linked together using a Legendre transform. Mirror descent can be viewed as a proximal algorithm where the distance generating function used is a Bregman divergence. A new class of proximal-gradient based temporal-difference (TD) methods are presented based on different Bregman divergences, which are more powerful than regular TD learning. Examples of Bregman divergences that are studied include p-norm functions, and Mahalanobis distance based on the covariance of sample gradients. A new family of sparse mirror-descent reinforcement learning methods are proposed, which are able to find sparse fixed points of an l1-regularized Bellman equation at significantly less computational cost than previous methods based on second-order matrix methods. An experimental study of mirror-descent reinforcement learning is presented using discrete and continuous Markov decision processes.},
