\chapter{Proposed Framework}
In this study we concentrate on automatic ensemble control of a special kind of devices: Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs). We will use one-sided centralised incentive-based architecture with restrictions on the overall involvement of participating loads. We develop \cite{Chertkov2017} ideas keeping the architecture requirements the same while making less assumptions on individual behaviour of devices.
